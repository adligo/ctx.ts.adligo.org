# ctx.ts.adligo.org
This is a similar project to ctx.adligo.org, but written in Type Script.  It will contain a Spring Core / microprofile like context, logger API and event bus for simple typescript projects like Angular or React.

### Note
I would have preferred to simply transpile the ctx.adligo.org Java to ts, but the state of Java Build Systems (Maven, Gradle, etc) is proving cumbersome again.  Because of this, I will probablly also resome work on Fabricate (2) perhaps making it a ts Java hybrid too.
